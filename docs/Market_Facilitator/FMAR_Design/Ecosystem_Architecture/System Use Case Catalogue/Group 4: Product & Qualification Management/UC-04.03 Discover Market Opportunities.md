| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Description**     | Enables an FSP to discover which flexibility products their registered Market Units may be eligible to qualify for, based on their technical and locational characteristics and a centrally managed set of equivalency rules.                                           |
| **Goal**            | To reduce FSP effort in discovering new revenue opportunities, accelerate the liquidity of new or updated flexibility markets, and promote the portability of qualifications across the GB market.                                                     |
| **Actors**          | FSP, Independent Market Platform, System Operator (when creating new products).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Preconditions**   | • The FSP's Market Units are defined in **PSQM**. <br> • The Product Catalogue and an accurate "Table of Equivalences" are maintained in **PSQM**.                                                                                                |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An FSP's authorised user initiates a query via the FMAR API/UI, specifying one or more Market Unit IDs. <br> 2. **PSQM** retrieves the technical data for the constituent assets of the Market Unit from **ARM**. <br> 3. **PSQM**'s logic engine compares these technical capabilities against the requirements of all active products in the Product Catalogue. <br> 4. The logic engine also applies rules from the Table of Equivalences (e.g., "if qualified for Product A, you are automatically eligible to apply for the less demanding Product B"). <br> 5. FMAR returns a structured list of products for which the Market Unit is likely eligible to apply for qualification (UC-04.01). |
| **Postconditions**  | • The FSP has a clear, actionable list of potential market opportunities for their portfolio. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Heavily relies on the accuracy of the Product Catalogue and the integrity of the logic within the Table of Equivalences. <br> • Depends on accurate technical data in **ARM**.                                                               |
| **Key Considerations** | • The "eligibility" provided is indicative and does not replace the formal SO qualification process (referenced in UC-04.02). <br> • The rules within the Table of Equivalences will require a robust industry governance process to define and maintain. |
