**Primary Module:** SPUM (Service Provider & User Module)  

| Element          | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| **Description**      | Onboards a new organisation (e.g., Flexibility Service Provider, System Operator, Independent Market Platform) as a recognised legal/commercial entity within the FMAR ecosystem, assigning them their primary role(s) to grant permissions.                                  |
| **Goal**             | To create a single, authoritative record for any organization interacting with FMAR, which can then be linked to users, assets, and market qualifications based on their assigned roles, ensuring a single point of identity management.                    |
| **Actors**           | Administrator of any new organisation wishing to join the FMAR ecosystem (e.g., FSP Admin, SO Admin)                                                                                                                              |
| **Preconditions**    | • The organisation must be a valid legal entity (e.g., registered with Companies House). <br> • The organisation must not already be registered in FMAR.         |
| **Process Summary**  | 1. An organisation's authorised representative initiates registration via the FMAR API/UI. <br> 2. They provide its core legal and commercial details and select their primary role(s) from a defined list. <br> 3. FMAR validates the information (potentially against external sources like Companies House). <br> 4. SPUM creates a unique FMAR Organisation ID and a master record for the entity, assigning the selected role(s) which grant a baseline set of permissions. |
| **Postconditions**   | • The organisation is registered and active within FMAR with a unique organisation ID. <br> • The FSP can now register its users (UC-01.01) who can then perform actions based on the organisation roles.                    |
| **Dependencies**     | • None. This is a primary onboarding step.                                                                                                      |
| **Key Considerations** | • The list of available "roles" needs to be clearly defined and governed. <br> • The process for validating entity authenticity must be robust and scalable for different organisation types. <br> • An organisation may hold multiple roles.                                                                           |
