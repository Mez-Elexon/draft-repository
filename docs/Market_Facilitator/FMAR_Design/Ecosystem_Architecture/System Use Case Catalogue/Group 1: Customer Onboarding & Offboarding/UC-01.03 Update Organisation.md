| Description        | Enables an authorised Organisation user to update their organisation's core details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Goal               | To ensure Organisation master data is accurate and to manage the clean exit of Organisations from the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Actors             | Relevant Organisation Administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Preconditions      | <p>• The Organisation is registered in SPUM.<br>• The requesting user has the appropriate administrative permissions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Process Summary    | <p><strong>Update:</strong> 1. Organisation Admin submits changes to their organisation's record via FMAR API/UI. 2. SPUM validates and updates the record.<br><strong>De-register:</strong> 1. FSP Admin initiates de-registration. 2. FMAR performs checks (e.g., are there still active assets?). 3. Upon confirmation, SPUM deactivates the Organisation record and associated user accounts.</p> |
| Postconditions     | <p>• (Update) Organisation record is updated.<br>• (De-register) Organisation record is marked as inactive and can no longer participate in market activities via FMAR.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Dependencies       | • De-registration may depend on the status of assets in ARM and qualifications in PSQM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Key Considerations | • Business rules for de-registration (e.g., handling of assets still registered to the Organisation) need to be clearly defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
