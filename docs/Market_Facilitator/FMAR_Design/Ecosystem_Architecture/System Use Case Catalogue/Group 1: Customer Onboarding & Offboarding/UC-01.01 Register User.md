| Description      | Enables the creation of individual user accounts within the FMAR ecosystem, linking them to a registered organisational entity.                 |
| Goal             | To establish authenticated and authorised user identities that can interact with FMAR according to their defined roles and permissions.         |
| Actors           | FSP Administrator, System Operator Administrator, Asset Owner, Independent Market Platform, Consumer Consent System, FMAR Administrator, Installer (potentially) .                                                                                  |
| Preconditions    | • The user's parent organization must be registered in SPUM (see UC-01.02).                                                                     |
| Process Summary  | 1. An authorised administrator for an organization initiates a new user registration via the FMAR API/UI. <br> 2. The user's details are provided and linked to the parent organization in SPUM. <br> 3. Appropriate roles and permissions are assigned to the user account. <br> 4. The user receives credentials and can be authenticated by FMAR. |
| Postconditions   | • A unique user account is created and active. <br> • The user can log in and perform actions according to their assigned permissions.          |
| Dependencies     | • Depends on the organisation first being registered via UC-01.02.                                                                              |
| Key Considerations | • The process must integrate with industry-standard identity and access management (IAM) protocols. <br> • A clear user role and permission model is required. |
