| **Description**        | Manages the formal, auditable process for an organization to be de-registered from the FMAR ecosystem, or for an individual user account to be deactivated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Goal**               | To ensure a clean, secure, and orderly exit for organizations and users, revoking all access rights and handling the lifecycle of associated data (e.g., assets, market units) according to defined business rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Actors**             | Administrator of the Organisation, FMAR Administrator (Elexon).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Preconditions**      | <p>• The Organisation and/or User is registered and active in SPUM.<br>• The requesting user has the appropriate administrative permissions for their organisation.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Process Summary**    | <p>1. An authorized Organisation Admin initiates a de-registration request via the FMAR API/UI.<br>2. FMAR initiates a validation check for dependencies (e.g., "Does this FSP still have active assets in <strong>ARM</strong> or qualified Market Units in <strong>PSQM</strong>?").<br>3. Based on business rules, the request may be rejected with instructions (e.g., "Please de-register all assets first") or proceed.<br>4. Upon successful validation, SPUM deactivates the Organisation's record and all associated user accounts, revoking all permissions.</p> |
| **Postconditions**     | <p>• The Organisation and its users are marked as "Inactive" in SPUM and can no longer log in or perform actions.<br>• An auditable record of the de-registration is created.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Dependencies**       | • The ability to de-register an Organisation is dependent on the status of its associated entities in ARM and PSQM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Key Considerations** | <p>• A clear offboarding policy must define the handling of an FSP's assets upon de-registration (e.g., are they automatically de-registered, or do they enter an 'orphaned' state requiring re-assignment?).<br>• The process for deactivating a single user must be distinct from de-registering the entire organisation.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
