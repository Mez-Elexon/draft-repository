| **Description**        | Enables authorised parties to access a detailed, immutable, and user-friendly audit trail of all significant changes made to data records within FMAR for which they have a legitimate interest.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Goal**               | To provide complete transparency and accountability for all data management activities within FMAR, supporting forensic analysis, dispute resolution, and regulatory oversight.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Actors**             | FSP (for their own data), System Operator (for data they interact with), Ofgem, FMAR Administrator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Preconditions**      | • The user is authenticated and authorised via SPUM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Process Summary**    | <p>1. An authorised user makes an API query to the FMAR Audit Layer for a specific record (e.g., by FMAR Asset ID or Market Unit ID).<br>2. The system retrieves the full version history for that record, including what data was changed, who made the change, and the precise timestamp.<br>3. The audit trail is returned in a secure, machine-readable format.</p> |
| **Postconditions**     | • The user receives a complete and trustworthy history of a data record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Dependencies**       | • Requires every data-modifying transaction in every FMAR module to be written to an immutable audit log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Key Considerations** | <p>• The audit trail itself must be protected from tampering.<br>• The level of detail and retention period for audit logs needs to be defined in a clear data policy.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                              |
