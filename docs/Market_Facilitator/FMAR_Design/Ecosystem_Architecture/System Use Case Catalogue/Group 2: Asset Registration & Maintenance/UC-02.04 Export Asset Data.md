| **Description**        | Enables an authorised entity (e.g., an FSP) to request and receive a secure, machine-readable export of all asset data associated with their FSP ID.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Goal**               | To support data portability, facilitate an FSP's withdrawal from a market platform, or enable offline analysis or backup of their registered asset portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Actors**             | Flexibility Service Provider (FSP), System User (with appropriate permissions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Preconditions**      | <p>- The requesting actor (FSP/User) is authenticated and authorised via SPUM.<br>- Assets associated with the actor's FSP ID exist within ARM.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Process Summary**    | <p>1. An authorised user initiates an export request via the relevant system interface or API.<br>2. The system validates the request and user permissions (via SPUM).<br>3. Relevant asset records are retrieved from ARM.<br>4. A secure, standardised data file (e.g., CSV, JSON) is generated and made available for download.</p> |
| **Postconditions**     | <p>- The user receives a complete and accurate data file of their asset portfolio.<br>- The action is logged for audit purposes.<br>- The asset data within the system remains unchanged.</p>                                                                                                                                          |
| **Dependencies**       | <p>- SPUM for authentication and authorisation.<br>- ARM as the source of asset data.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Key Considerations** | <p>- Export format must align with the Common Ontology.<br>- The process must support large data volumes.<br>- Strong security controls must be in place to protect data in transit and at rest.<br>- Are there any legal or ethical considerations missing?</p>                                                                       |
