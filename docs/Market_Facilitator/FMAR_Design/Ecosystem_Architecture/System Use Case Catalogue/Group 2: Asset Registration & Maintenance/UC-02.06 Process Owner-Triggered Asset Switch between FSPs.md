| \*Process Summary  | <p>1. <strong>Consent &#x26; Initiation:</strong> Consumer provides explicit consent to switch to the Gaining FSP via the <strong>Consumer Consent Solution</strong>. This solution generates a secure authorisation token/proof.<br>2. <strong>Request:</strong> The Gaining FSP (or the Consent Solution directly) submits a "Switch Asset" request to FMAR, providing the FMAR Asset ID(s) and the authorisation proof.<br>3. <strong>Verification:</strong> FMAR's <strong>ARM</strong> validates the authorisation proof by making a real-time call to the <strong>Consumer Consent Solution</strong> (UC-05.05).<br>4. <strong>Notification &#x26; Re-assignment:</strong> Upon successful verification, FMAR notifies the Losing FSP of the pending switch (with a defined notice period). <strong>ARM</strong> updates the FSP link for the asset. If the asset was the sole component of a Market Unit, <strong>PSQM</strong> re-assigns the entire unit (UC-03.02). If it was part of a larger group, the Market Unit composition is updated (UC-03.03).</p> |
