| **Description**        | Manages the authoritative change of the FSP responsible for a Market Unit within the FMAR ecosystem, ensuring all associated data and qualifications are correctly re-assigned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Goal**               | To provide a standardised, secure, and auditable mechanism for transferring the commercial responsibility for a Market Unit, supporting market dynamics like M\&A activity and consumer switching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Actors**             | FMAR Administrator, FSP (Gaining/Losing), FMAR System.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Preconditions**      | <p>• The Market Unit exists in PSQM.<br>• Both FSPs are registered in SPUM.<br>• An external, authorised trigger for the switch has occurred (e.g., a completed consumer switch request, a commercial portfolio sale agreement).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Process Summary**    | <p>1. An authorised party (e.g., Gaining FSP, FMAR Admin) initiates a "Re-assign Market Unit" request via the FMAR API.<br>2. The request provides evidence of authorisation for the switch.<br>3. <strong>PSQM</strong> validates the request and re-assigns the Market Unit's FSP link from the Losing FSP's record to the Gaining FSP's record in SPUM.<br>4. Associated qualifications are transferred as per defined business rules.</p> |
| **Postconditions**     | <p>• Commercial responsibility for the Market Unit is successfully transferred.<br>• An auditable record of the switch is created.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
