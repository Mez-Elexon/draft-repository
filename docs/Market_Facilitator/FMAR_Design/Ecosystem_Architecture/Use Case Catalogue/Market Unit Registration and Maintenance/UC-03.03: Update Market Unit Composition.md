| **Description**        | Allows an FSP to add or remove assets from an existing Market Unit.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Goal**               | To enable dynamic management of Market Units in response to asset churn, while maintaining accurate qualification status.                                                                                                      |
| **Actors**             | FSP, System Operator (as a recipient of notifications)                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Preconditions**      | • The Market Unit exists. <br> • The FSP is authorised via SPUM. <br> • Added assets are active in ARM.                                                                                                                        |
| **Process Summary**    | 1. FSP submits an update request with new asset list. <br> 2. PSQM links/unlinks asset records from ARM. <br> 3. System checks for “material” changes. <br> 4. If material, requalification is triggered and SOs are notified. |
| **Postconditions**     | • Updated Market Unit composition. <br> • If material, status changes to "Re-assessment Required."                                                                                                                             |
| **Dependencies**       | • Asset data from ARM. <br> • Identity/auth from SPUM. <br> • May involve GICM for requalification.                                                                                                                            |
| **Key Considerations** | • Defining "material change" is critical. <br> • The process should be efficient to encourage data accuracy.                                                                                                                   |
