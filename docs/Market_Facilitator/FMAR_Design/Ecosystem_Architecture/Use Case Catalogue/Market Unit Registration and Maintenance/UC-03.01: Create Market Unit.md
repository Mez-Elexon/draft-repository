| **Description**        | Enables an authorised FSP to logically group one or more of its registered assets to form a new "Market Unit" (equivalent to an SPU or SPG).                                                                                                                              |
| **Goal**               | To empower FSPs to translate their physical asset portfolio (from ARM) into new, commercially-defined units that can be qualified and offered into flexibility markets.                                                                                                |
| **Actors**             | Flexibility Service Provider (FSP)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Preconditions**      | • The FSP is registered and authenticated via SPUM. <br> • The constituent assets are registered and active in ARM.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Process Summary**    | 1. An FSP's authorised user initiates a "Create Market Unit" request via the FMAR API. <br> 2. The FSP provides a unique name/ID and a list of FMAR Asset IDs. <br> 3. PSQM validates the FSP’s authority and creates the new Market Unit, linking it to ARM and SPUM. |
| **Postconditions**     | • A new Market Unit is created in PSQM. <br> • The Market Unit is ready for the qualification process (UC-03.02).                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Dependencies**       | • Relies on authoritative asset records from ARM. <br> • Relies on FSP identity from SPUM.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Key Considerations** | • Business rules for Market Unit composition (e.g., a unit must contain at least one asset) must be clearly defined.                                                                                                                                                   |
