| **Description**     | Manages the authoritative change of the FSP responsible for a Market Unit within the FMAR ecosystem, ensuring all associated data and qualifications are correctly re-assigned.                                                       |
| **Goal**            | To provide a standardised, secure, and auditable mechanism for transferring the commercial responsibility for a Market Unit, supporting market dynamics like M&A activity and consumer switching.                                       |
| **Actors**          | FMAR Administrator, FSP (Gaining/Losing), FMAR System.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Preconditions**   | • The Market Unit exists in PSQM. <br> • Both FSPs are registered in SPUM. <br> • An external, authorised trigger for the switch has occurred (e.g., a completed consumer switch request, a commercial portfolio sale agreement). |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised party (e.g., Gaining FSP, FMAR Admin) initiates a "Re-assign Market Unit" request via the FMAR API. <br> 2. The request provides evidence of authorisation for the switch. <br> 3. **PSQM** validates the request and re-assigns the Market Unit's FSP link from the Losing FSP's record to the Gaining FSP's record in SPUM. <br> 4. Associated qualifications are transferred as per defined business rules. |
| **Postconditions**  | • Commercial responsibility for the Market Unit is successfully transferred. <br> • An auditable record of the switch is created.                                                                                                    |
| **Dependencies**    | • Relies on FSP identities managed in SPUM. |
| **Key Considerations** | • This is the core technical function. The *trigger* for this function can come from various business processes, such as the one detailed in UC-03.05. |
