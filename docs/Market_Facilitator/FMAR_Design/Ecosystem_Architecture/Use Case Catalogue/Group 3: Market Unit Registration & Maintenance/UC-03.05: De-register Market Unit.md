| **Description**     | The formal process for an FSP to permanently remove a Market Unit (SPU/SPG) from FMAR. This action dissolves the logical grouping of assets but does not de-register the constituent assets themselves.                                                                    |
| **Goal**            | To allow FSPs to cleanly manage their commercial portfolio by removing Market Units that are no longer needed (e.g., due to changes in market strategy), while maintaining the integrity of the underlying asset records in ARM.                |
| **Actors**          | FSP, Independent Market Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Preconditions**   | • The Market Unit exists in **PSQM**. <br> • The requesting user is authenticated via **SPUM** and has the authority to manage the Market Unit. <br> • The Market Unit is not subject to any active, in-flight commercial obligations that would prevent its removal. |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised FSP user submits a "De-register Market Unit" request via the FMAR API, specifying the Market Unit ID. <br> 2. **PSQM** validates the request and performs dependency checks (e.g., are there active qualifications or contracts associated with this unit that need to be terminated first?). <br> 3. Business rules will determine if the request can proceed or must be rejected with instructions. <br> 4. Upon successful validation, **PSQM** updates the Market Unit's status to "De-registered," effectively dissolving the unit. The links between the unit and its constituent assets in **ARM** are removed. |
| **Postconditions**  | • The Market Unit is marked as "De-registered" in **PSQM** and can no longer be used in any market activities. <br> • The constituent assets remain registered in **ARM** and can be re-assigned to new Market Units. <br> • An auditable record of the de-registration is created. |
| **Dependencies**    | • The ability to de-register a Market Unit may be dependent on its contractual status, which might be managed in external systems.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Key Considerations** | • This action is distinct from `UC-02.03: De-register Asset`. The assets themselves persist in FMAR after this action. <br> • Clear business rules are needed to handle dependencies. For example, the system should prevent de-registration of a Market Unit that is currently awarded a contract. |
