This document outlines the core use cases for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) solution.

Depending on the outcomes from Industry design workshops, FMAR could support asset registration (potentially collecting data from the point of installation), unit (asset grouping) rights and market qualification, and data sharing for flexible assets participating in GB flexibility markets.

It is designed to operate through modular components and some data flows potentially using a federated architecture via the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI). The modules reflect logical groupings to the lifecycle of asset data in the Registration phase of flexibility markets.

To further understand what is in the Registration phase, we encourage you to refer to Elexon's Common End-to-End process workstream which provides a reference model 

This data would be an authoritative master record and have a unified API and reporting layer to support role-based access control on a non-discriminatory basis, underpinned by a common set of data standards and a shared ontology.

### Module Key

- **SPUM** â€“ Service Provider & User Module  
- **ARM** â€“ Asset Registration Module  
- **PSQM** â€“ Product & Service Qualification Module  
- **GICM** â€“ Grid Interaction & Constraints Module  
- **API Layer** â€“ Federated data access layer for authorised consumers  
- **Reporting Layer** â€“ Common reporting interface drawing from all modules

**ðŸ”¶ = Expected to be out of scope for go-live. May be prioritised depending on stakeholder workshop outcomes.**
