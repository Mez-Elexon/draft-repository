This document outlines the core use cases for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) solution.

FMAR could support asset registration, unit qualification and data sharing for flexible assets participating in GB flexibility markets.

It is designed to operate through modular components and may leverage a federated architecture via the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI). These modules are logical groups of xyz and would have a unified API and reporting layer to support role-based access control on a non-discriminatory basis, underpinned by a common data standard and a shared ontology.

### Module Key

- **SPUM** â€“ Service Provider & User Module  
- **ARM** â€“ Asset Registration Module  
- **PSQM** â€“ Product & Service Qualification Module  
- **GICM** â€“ Grid Interaction & Constraints Module  
- **API Layer** â€“ Federated data access layer for authorised consumers  
- **Reporting Layer** â€“ Common reporting interface drawing from all modules

**ðŸ”¶ = Expected to be out of scope for go-live. May be prioritised depending on stakeholder workshop outcomes.**

### **FMAR Use Case to Module Mapping**

This table outlines the full scope of defined use cases for the FMAR programme and maps them to the logical data module(s) responsible for their delivery. This illustrates the interconnected nature of the FMAR Hub and supports the need for a holistic design approach, even though capabilities will be delivered in phased releases.
