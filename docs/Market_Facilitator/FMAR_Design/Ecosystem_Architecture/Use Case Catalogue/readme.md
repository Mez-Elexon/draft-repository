# FMAR Use Case Catalogue: Complete Summary

This document outlines the core use cases for the Flexibility Market Asset Register (FMAR).

FMAR supports registration, qualification, and data sharing for flexible assets participating in GB flexibility markets.

It is designed to operate through modular components and may leverage a federated architecture via the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI).

## Quick Definitions

â€¢ An 'Asset' (or in the European case a Controllable Unit (CU)) is defined as a single power-generating module and/or demand unit.

â€¢ A Service Providing Unit (SPU) refers to one or more controllable units connected to a single
connection point, as defined by the service provider.

â€¢ A Service Providing Group (SPG) is an aggregation of CUs or SPUs connected to more than one
connection point within the same scheduling area, also defined by the service provider
