| **Description**     | The formal process for an authorised user to permanently change the status of an asset's registration in FMAR to "De-registered," for instance, when the asset is decommissioned, no longer capable of providing flexibility, or is being permanently removed from all flexibility markets. |
| **Goal**            | To maintain an accurate and current register of *active* flexible assets in GB by providing a formal, auditable process to manage the end-of-life of an asset's participation in the flexibility ecosystem.                                                                  |
| **Actors**          | FSP, Asset Owner (via FSP), Independent Market Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Preconditions**   | • The asset is registered in **ARM**. <br> • The requesting user is authenticated via **SPUM** and authorised to manage the asset. <br> • The asset is not currently an active member of any Market Unit in **PSQM**.                                                 |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised user submits a "De-register Asset" request via the FMAR API, specifying the FMAR Asset ID. <br> 2. **ARM** validates the request and performs a dependency check with **PSQM** to confirm the asset is not part of any active Market Unit. <br> 3. If the asset is still linked to a Market Unit, the API returns an error instructing the user to first remove it from the unit (using UC-03.03). <br> 4. If the dependency check passes, **ARM** updates the asset's status to "De-registered". |
| **Postconditions**  | • The asset is marked as "De-registered" in **ARM**. <br> • The asset can no longer be included in new Market Units or any future market activities via FMAR. <br> • An auditable record of the de-registration event is created. |
| **Dependencies**    | • The ability to de-register an asset is critically dependent on its status within **PSQM**; it must be unlinked from all Market Units first. |
| **Key Considerations** | • This action is about changing the asset's *status* and is distinct from UC-02.05: Export Asset Data. <br> • A clear data retention policy must define how long the historical data of a de-registered asset is retained for audit and reporting purposes before potential archiving or anonymization. <br> • De-registering should be a "soft delete" (changing status) rather than a hard delete to maintain historical integrity. |
