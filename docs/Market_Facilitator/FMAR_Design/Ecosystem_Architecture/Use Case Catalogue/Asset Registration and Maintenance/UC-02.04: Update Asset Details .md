| Element          | Description                                                                                                                            |

| **Description**      | Enables an authorised user to modify the attributes of an already registered asset.                                                   |
| **Goal**             | To maintain the accuracy of the asset "Single Source of Truth" over its lifecycle.                                                     |
| **Actors**           | FSP, Asset Owner.                                                                                                                      |
| **Preconditions**    | • The asset exists in ARM. <br> • The user is authorised via SPUM to manage the asset.                                                |
| **Process Summary**  | 1. User submits updated data for an asset via the FMAR API, referencing its FMAR Asset ID. <br> 2. ARM validates the new data. <br> 3. The asset record is updated, with previous versions retained for audit purposes (versioning). <br> 4. If the FSP is changed, the link to SPUM is updated. |
| **Postconditions**   | • The asset's record in ARM reflects the latest information. <br> • The update is versioned and auditable.                            |
| **Dependencies**     | • Changes might trigger a re-assessment in PSQM or GICM.                                                                               |
| **Key Considerations** | • Material changes (e.g., capacity) must trigger notifications to relevant parties.                                                    |
