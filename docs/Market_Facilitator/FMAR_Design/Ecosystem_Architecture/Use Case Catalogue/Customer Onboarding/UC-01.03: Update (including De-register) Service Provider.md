| Element          | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| Description      | Enables an authorised Organisation user to update their organisation's core details or to formally de-register the organisation from the FMAR ecosystem. |
| Goal             | To ensure Organisation master data is accurate and to manage the clean exit of Organisations from the market.                                                     |
| Actors           | Relevant Organisation Administrator                                                                                                                               |
| Preconditions    | • The Organisation is registered in SPUM. <br> • The requesting user has the appropriate administrative permissions.                                    |
| Process Summary  | **Update:** 1. Organisation Admin submits changes to their organisation's record via FMAR API/UI. 2. SPUM validates and updates the record. <br> **De-register:** 1. FSP Admin initiates de-registration. 2. FMAR performs checks (e.g., are there still active assets?). 3. Upon confirmation, SPUM deactivates the Organisation record and associated user accounts. |
| Postconditions   | • (Update) Organisation record is updated. <br> • (De-register) Organisation record is marked as inactive and can no longer participate in market activities via FMAR. |
| Dependencies     | • De-registration may depend on the status of assets in ARM and qualifications in PSQM.                                                         |
| Key Considerations | • Business rules for de-registration (e.g., handling of assets still registered to the Organisation) need to be clearly defined.                        |
