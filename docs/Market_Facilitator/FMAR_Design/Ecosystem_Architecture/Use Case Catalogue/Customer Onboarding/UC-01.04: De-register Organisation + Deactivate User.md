| **Description**     | Manages the formal, auditable process for an organization to be de-registered from the FMAR ecosystem, or for an individual user account to be deactivated.                                                                                                                |
| **Goal**            | To ensure a clean, secure, and orderly exit for organizations and users, revoking all access rights and handling the lifecycle of associated data (e.g., assets, market units) according to defined business rules.                                                        |
| **Actors**          | Administrator of the Organisation, FMAR Administrator (Elexon).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Preconditions**   | • The Organisation and/or User is registered and active in SPUM. <br> • The requesting user has the appropriate administrative permissions for their organisation.                                                                                                     |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorized Organisation Admin initiates a de-registration request via the FMAR API/UI. <br> 2. FMAR initiates a validation check for dependencies (e.g., "Does this FSP still have active assets in **ARM** or qualified Market Units in **PSQM**?"). <br> 3. Based on business rules, the request may be rejected with instructions (e.g., "Please de-register all assets first") or proceed. <br> 4. Upon successful validation, SPUM deactivates the Organisation's record and all associated user accounts, revoking all permissions. |
| **Postconditions**  | • The Organisation and its users are marked as "Inactive" in SPUM and can no longer log in or perform actions. <br> • An auditable record of the de-registration is created. |
| **Dependencies**    | • The ability to de-register an Organisation is dependent on the status of its associated entities in ARM and PSQM. |
| **Key Considerations** | • A clear offboarding policy must define the handling of an FSP's assets upon de-registration (e.g., are they automatically de-registered, or do they enter an 'orphaned' state requiring re-assignment?). <br> • The process for deactivating a single user must be distinct from de-registering the entire organisation. |
