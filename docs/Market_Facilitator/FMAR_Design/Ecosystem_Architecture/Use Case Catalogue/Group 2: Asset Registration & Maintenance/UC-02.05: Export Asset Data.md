# Use Case UC-02.05: Export Asset Data  
**Primary Module:** Asset Registration Module 

| **Element**       | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Description**   | Enables an authorised entity (e.g., an FSP) to request and receive a secure, machine-readable export of all asset data associated with their FSP ID. |
| **Goal**          | To support data portability, facilitate an FSP's withdrawal from a market platform, or enable offline analysis or backup of their registered asset portfolio. |
| **Actors**        | Flexibility Service Provider (FSP), System User (with appropriate permissions). |
| **Preconditions** | - The requesting actor (FSP/User) is authenticated and authorised via SPUM.<br>- Assets associated with the actor's FSP ID exist within ARM. |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised user initiates an export request via the relevant system interface or API.<br>2. The system validates the request and user permissions (via SPUM).<br>3. Relevant asset records are retrieved from ARM.<br>4. A secure, standardised data file (e.g., CSV, JSON) is generated and made available for download. |
| **Postconditions** | - The user receives a complete and accurate data file of their asset portfolio.<br>- The action is logged for audit purposes.<br>- The asset data within the system remains unchanged. |
| **Dependencies**  | - SPUM for authentication and authorisation.<br>- ARM as the source of asset data. |
| **Key Considerations** | - Export format must align with the Common Ontology.<br>- The process must support large data volumes.<br>- Strong security controls must be in place to protect data in transit and at rest. <br>- Are there any legal or ethical considerations missing? |
