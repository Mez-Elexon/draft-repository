## Agile Design & Feedback Framework
**Date:** 31.07.2025
**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Publish
The Architecture Team publishes a new version of an artefact (e.g. version 1.0) to the main branch.

### 2. Discussion
- Straightforward questions are answered directly in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/discussions).
- More complex discussions are taken to a relevant workshop. 

### 3. Industry Raises Issues
Industry participants raise new requirements or design changes by raising [Issues](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/issues) (formal) or starting Discussions (informal).  

### 4. Review and Labelling
The Architecture Team reviews all incoming Issues and adds labels to help track them (e.g. "question", "proposal", "workshop input needed").

### 5. Decision
The Architecture Team decides how to respond to each Issue (e.g. accept the suggestion, reject it, or request more information).

### 6. Update the Artefact
If accepted, the team updates their internal version of the artefact to reflect the change.

### 7. Publish New Version
The updated artefact is published as a new version (e.g. version 2.0), with a clear summary of changes and links to the relevant Issues.

### 8. Close the Issue
The Architecture Team closes the Issue, adding a comment that links to the updated artefact or commit where the feedback was addressed.

## Rules of Engagement / Contribution guidelines (work in progress):

- We will walkthrough how to use the GitHub at the end of today's session

- In general, try to ensure your Issue has demonstrable broad inter-organisational support and aligns with the FMAR vision.

- Proposing a two weeks 'refinement window' on artefacts following presentation in workshop. We acknowledge there are lots of Use Cases and timing could be a challenge, we need to move quickly to meet Phase 2 milestone. Priority ones for review are UC group 1 and 2.
