# FMAR Design Workshop #1: Programme Vision, Scope & Use Case Foundations

**Date:** 31.07.2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Welcome & Purpose

Welcome to the first design workshop for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) Programme. Thank you for your time and expertise.

**The Goal of Today's Session:** To establish a shared understanding of the FMAR vision, agree on our collaborative design process, and begin the crucial work of walking through and prioritising the core use cases that will define the FMAR at go-live and it's backlog.

This document will act as our **anchor and agenda** for the day. We will be screen-sharing and walking through the linked artefacts, so please feel free to follow along here.

## Session 4: Ecosystem Architecture - Use Case Catalogue Walkthrough (50 mins)

This is the core interactive part of our session. We will walk through the draft Use Case Catalogue to build a shared understanding.

*   **Primary Artefact:** **[FMAR Use Case Catalogue](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/tree/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Ecosystem_Architecture/Use%20Case%20Catalogue)**

*   **How to Participate:**
    1.  We will screen-share and walk through the main use cases within the catalogue.
    2.  As we discuss each use case, please provide your comments, questions, and initial thoughts on priority.
    3.  **To capture feedback in real-time, please use our parallel Slido:** **[slido link](https://app.sli.do/event/gTRg9GodizNrKHLDjo3L4Q/embed/polls/cbcae429-0511-4ed6-b329-a1cceb229010)**.
