Welcome to the FMAR Design Repository. This is a collaborative space for industry participants to review design artefacts and provide feedback to the FMAR Architecture Team. Our design philosophy is open and pragmatic, and your expert input is essential to the success of this initiative.

To ensure the process is efficient and transparent for everyone, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing.

## Code of Conduct

All engagement in this repository is governed by a professional code of conduct. We are committed to providing a collaborative and welcoming environment for all. Please ensure your contributions are:

- **Constructive**: Focus on improving the design and solving problems.
- **Respectful**: Engage in courteous and professional dialogue.
- **Inclusive**: We encourage participation from all corners of the industry and value diverse perspectives.

## Getting Started: Staying Informed

- **Sign-up to GitHub**: Create a free account [here](https://github.com/) to get started. Watch this quick 2 minute [User Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y32Rm9WRHGU) for further details about GitHub.

This repository is an active development space. To stay informed without being overwhelmed by notifications:

- **Do NOT ‘Watch’ All Activity**: This will create excessive email noise.
- **DO Bookmark Key Pages**: We recommend you bookmark the following pages to see the latest updates:
  - The [FMAR Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/elexon-data/projects/1): For a high-level view of work in progress.
  - The [Discussions Page](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/discussions): For ongoing conversations and clarifications.
  - The [Issues Page](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/issues): For live issues.

- **DO Subscribe to Official Channels**: All major artefact releases, consultation periods, and workshop announcements will be communicated via the official [Flex News](https://www.elexon.co.uk/news-insights/subscribe-to-our-newsletter-and-circulars/) and other established Elexon email channels.

## How to Provide Feedback: Issues vs. Discussions

We use GitHub Issues and Discussions as our primary mechanisms for asynchronous feedback. Please use them as follows:

**Use Discussions for:**

- Clarification Questions: If you need to better understand a part of an artefact.
- Informal Suggestions: For raising ideas or "what if" scenarios that are not yet fully formed proposals.
- General Comments: For broader feedback that doesn't constitute a specific change request.

**Use Issues for:**

- Formal Change Requests: When you have a well-reasoned proposal for a specific change to a design artefact.
- Identifying Gaps or Missing Requirements: If you believe a critical requirement or use case is missing.
- Highlighting Conflicts or Major Risks: If you see a conflict between FMAR artefacts or with other industry initiatives.

_In short: Use Discussions for questions and ideas; use Issues for concrete proposals._

## Raising a Formal Issue (Change Request)

To make Issues as effective as possible, please follow this structure:

- **Clear Title**: Briefly summarize the proposed change (e.g., "Add 'Asset Commissioning Date' to ARM Core Data Model").
- **Reference the Artefact**: In the body of the Issue, provide a direct link to the specific artefact and version you are referencing. This is crucial for triage.
- **State the "Problem" or "Opportunity"**: Clearly explain why the change is needed. What problem does it solve? What opportunity does it enable? Does it meet our self-scoring matrix?
- **Propose the "Solution"**: Detail your suggested change.
- **State Your Identity**: Please clearly state your name, organisation, and role so we can understand the context of your feedback.

## The Feedback Review Workflow

We are committed to a transparent and timely feedback process.

### Publication & Review Window

- The FMAR Architecture Team will publish new or updated design artefacts to the main branch of the repository.
- An official review period will be announced via our Announcements thread on Discussions forum. Industry participants will typically have two weeks following workshops to raise formal Issues.

### Triage & Labelling

- The Architecture Team will review all new Issues and Discussions on a regular basis.
- We will structure the discussions forum and apply labels to Issues to help categorise and prioritise feedback.

### Response & Decision

- Every Issue will receive a response from the Architecture Team.
- **Simple issues** may be accepted or rejected directly with a clear rationale.
- **Complex or contentious issues** that require broader input will be labelled appropriately and added to the backlog for discussion at the relevant FMAR Industry Insights Design Group workshop.

### Closing the Loop

- If a change is accepted, the Architecture Team will update the relevant artefact in an internal branch.
- Periodically, a new version of the artefact (e.g., v1.2) will be published to the main branch. The release notes will summarise the changes and reference the Issue numbers that were addressed.
- The original Issue will be closed with a comment linking to the commit or release where the change was implemented.
