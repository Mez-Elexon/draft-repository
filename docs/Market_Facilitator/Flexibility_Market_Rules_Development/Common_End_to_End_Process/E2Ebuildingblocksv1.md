# üìò Business Process Building Blocks Glossary v1

## Common End-to-End Process Workstream Toolkit

This document outlines the **Flexibility Market Business Processes and Systems**, with a focus on the **FSP User Journey**.

We are developing a shared glossary to support understanding of key concepts (e.g., *Asset*, *Unit*), starting with a pragmatic and lightweight approach using Excel. We will progressively transition to structured JSON, and eventually machine-readable formats.

### Key Interview Themes

In initial stakeholder interviews, we will explore:

- **a)** Business processes you undertake
- **b)** Data and communication flows supporting information exchange
- **c)** Interfacing systems and platforms

We focus primarily on FSP interactions and Independent Market Platforms, with secondary attention to DERMS and System Operators.
