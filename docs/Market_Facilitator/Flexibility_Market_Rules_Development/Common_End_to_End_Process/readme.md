# Common End to End process 

**See the latest updates on our work to define a common 'End to End process' for flexibility services**

The latest building blocks can be found [here](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/blob/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/Flexibility_Market_Rules_Development/Common_End_to_End_Process/Common%20End-to-End%20Process%20Workstream%20Toolkit%20v3.0.md)

## Aims
As set out in the terms of reference, the scope of the work is to:

* Provide feedback on the workstreamâ€™s canonical vocabulary and conceptual model used to describe business processes that make up a common end-to-end process for flexibility service delivery and facilitate stakeholder consensus on contested or ambiguous terms.
* Provide continuous validation and feedback on how the end-to-end process differs across sub-markets (e.g., DNO Scheduled Utilisation vs. NESO Slow Reserve), based on experience and content produced from structured bilateral engagement undertaken by the workstream.
* Provide input to improve the accessibility of workstream artefacts (e.g. glossaries, concept maps) intended for 
Industry re-use, and the desired end state of such artefacts.
