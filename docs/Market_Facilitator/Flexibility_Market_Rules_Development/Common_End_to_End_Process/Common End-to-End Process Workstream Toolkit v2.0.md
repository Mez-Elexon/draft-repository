This document outlines the conceptual model for **Flexibility Market Business Processes and Systems**, with a focus on the **FSP User Journey**, as part of the Common End-to-End Process workstream.

We are developing a shared glossary to support understanding of key concepts (e.g., *Asset*, *Unit*), starting with a pragmatic and lightweight approach using Excel. We will progressively transition to structured JSON, and eventually machine-readable formats.

### Key Interview Themes

In initial stakeholder interviews, we will explore:

- **a)** Business processes you undertake, including pre-conditions, post-conditions and data object input/outputs that are useful for FSPs to know

Where possible:
- **b)** Data and communication flows supporting information exchange
- **c)** Interfacing systems and platforms

We focus primarily on FSP interactions and Independent Market Platforms, with secondary attention to DERMS and System Operators.

### Workstream Phases

| Phase                | Focus                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **July–August**      | Interviews focused on remaining phases                                 |
| **August**       | Open industry workshop to review as-is swimlanes captured from interviews (Level 3 Enterprise Model views)   |
| **September**        | Confirm role of this toolkit in Day 1 Flexibility Market consultation   |
| **Continuous**       | Open contributions via collaboration tools                             |
