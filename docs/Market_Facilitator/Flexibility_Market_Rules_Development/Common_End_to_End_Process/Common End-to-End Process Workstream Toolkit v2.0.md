This workstream has three main lofty aims:
1) to provide a framework to align business processes between System Operators, which is a prerequisite for any efficient technical solutions (like FMAR) that aims to promote interoperability and market liquidity
2) to produce a useful toolkit for FSPs on the user journey to signpost basic inputs/outputs required for each market phase and
3) to provide foundation for a machine-readable conceptual model of the 'flexibility market' to support reasoning in the flexibility market catalogue.

This document outlines the conceptual model for flexibility market business processes with a focus on aspects relevant to the **FSP User Journey**, as part of the Common End-to-End Process workstream.


### Interview Discussions

In initial stakeholder interviews, we will explore:

- **a)** Business processes you undertake, including pre-conditions, post-conditions and data object input/outputs that are useful for FSPs to know

Where possible:
- **b)** Data and communication flows supporting information exchange
- **c)** Interfacing systems and platforms

We focus primarily on FSP interactions and Independent Market Platforms, with secondary attention to DERMS and System Operators.
